        "Ada Lovelace: Although she lived well before the invention of modern computers, Ada Lovelace is one of the most famous women in computer science history. Born Augusta Ada Byron, she was the only child of the famous poet Lord Byron who was not born out of wedlock. A few weeks after Ada’s birth, her parents separated, with her mathematically gifted mother taking sole custody of Ada. Her mother managed to steer her away from poetry and towards mathematics and science, but Ada’s understanding of the latter subjects was influenced by the imagination she inherited from her father.\nToday, the Countess of Lovelace is best known for her work on the Analytical Engine, a general-purpose computer designed by Charles Babbage. She is recognized as the first computer programmer for her notes on the machine.",
        "Admiral Grace Hopper: Grace Murray Hopper, dubbed “Amazing Grace” for reasons that will become obvious, was at the forefront of the relatively new field of computer science. She earned a master’s degree and Ph.D. from Yale in Mathematics in the early 1930s, taught for several years at Vasser College, where she had obtained her bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Physics, then joined the Navy in 1943 when the U.S. entered World War II. Because of her age and small frame, Hopper had to receive a special exemption to join the Navy.\nDuring her naval career, Grace attained the rank of rear admiral and worked on the Harvard Mark I and Mark II computers. Although she left active service in 1946, she remained a Navy reservist and even returned to active duty at the age of 60 to help standardize the Navy’s computer programming languages. She retired at the age of 79 as the oldest serving officer in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nIn the private sector, her team developed the first computer language compiler, A-0, as well as Flow-Matic, the first programming language to use English-like commands. She also worked on the UNIVAC I computer and helped popularize COBOL, the first standardized general business computer language. A College of Yale University is named in her honor.",
        "The ENIAC Team: If you read “Famous Women in Computer Science” and immediately think of the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” you’re not alone. NASA was not the only organization hiring female mathematicians to serve as human computers. During World War II, some of the best and brightest were selected to calculate ballistic trajectories. Many later moved into technology careers, working on the UNIVAC I computer with Grace Hopper as well as ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), the world’s first general-purpose computer.\nOn the eve of its debut, ENIAC was non-operational. A group of women who had been working on the machine stayed late to fix it. Their names were Betty Jean Jennings Bartik, Kathleen McNulty, Mauchly Antonelli, Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum, Frances Bilas Spence, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, and Frances Snyder Holberton. All deserve a place on the list of famous computer scientists, though they are best remembered for their collective work.",
        "Sister Mary Kenneth Keller: Giving Lord Byron’s daughter a run for her money in the category of “people you wouldn’t expect to be famous computer scientists” is Sister Mary Kenneth Keller. Keller was a nun of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1965 at Washington University, she became one of the first two people — and, notably, the first woman — to earn a doctorate in computer science.\nKeller also earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Master of Science in Mathematics and conducted research at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Michigan, Dartmouth College, and Purdue. At Dartmouth, she helped develop the BASIC computer language that allowed even those not well-versed in mathematics to write computer code.",
        "Radia Perlman is commonly acknowledged as the “Mother of the Internet.” Perlman herself disputes this title, though, noting that many people contributed to the invention of the internet. Her own contributions were fundamental to the technology, though, as she developed the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) that made the internet possible. It works as a sort of traffic pattern that includes multiple links between network points so that if one link fails, backups are always ready to ensure the data is still accessible. In 2000, she released “Interconnection,” a textbook that simplified network routing and bridging.\nPerlman earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT. Her mother was a mathematician/computer programmer like some of the women mentioned above. Interestingly, despite the contributions of such women, computer science still looked like a male-dominated field when Perlman attended MIT in the late 60s and 70s. She was one of about 50 female students in a class of 1,000. Over the course of her career, Perlman has held more than 80 patents related to internet technology, and she has received several awards recognizing her importance in the field of computer science. In 2014, Perlman was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.\nReady to watch a tech-talented protagonist put her computer science skills to work? Check out #WarGames, Eko’s new interactive series that’s loosely based on the 1983 movie “WarGames.” #WarGames puts a new spin on the original by replacing Matthew Broderick’s teen hacker with a female lead and updating the plot to reflect the modern political and technological landscape. You’ll even get to make your own contribution, as your viewing behavior affects key plot points and the main character’s development.",
        "Annie Easley made the jump from 'human computer' to computer programmer while working at the mid-century agency of what would become NASA. Running simulations at a freaking 'Reactor Lab,' she was one of only four African-American employees. She is well known for her work encouraging women and people of color to enter STEM fields.\nLater, her work as a programmer involved energy conversion systems. According to NASA, she developed and implemented code that led to the development of the battery used in the first hybrid cars. You're welcome, Prius drivers.",
        "Karen Spärck Jones: The search engines we use daily rely on the natural language processing discoveries made by one female computer scientist, Karen Spärck Jones. She was recruited to Cambridge into the Language Research Unit by another female professor, the computational linguist Margaret Masterman.\nJones' most notable achievements laid the groundwork for the sort of information retrieval we use today. She introduced the use of thesauri into language processing, allowing for computational recognition of similar words. And she also introduced the idea and methods of 'term weighing' in information retrieval, which helped queries determine which terms were the most relevant.",
        "Limor Fried: Limor Fried founded Adafruit Industries from her dorm room at MIT. A veteran of DIY hardware hacking, she wanted to make building electronics at home easier. In 2005, the 'maker culture' pioneer officially launched her online store and started selling all the tools and equipment any hacker could want. Today, Adafruit earns more than $40 million annually selling over a thousand different parts. The shop stocks most everything you need to overclock an old iMac, build an LCD display or light up a cosplay costume. The Adafruit website also hosts a variety of how-to guides for anyone looking to boost their circuit-bending skills. The company has over 100 employees who work out of a 50,000-square-foot factory in New York City. In 2016, the White House named Fried one of 10 'Champions of Change for Making.' She also received the O'Reilly Open Source Award at the Open Source Convention in 2013 and was the first 'lady engineer' featured on the cover of Wired magazine.",
